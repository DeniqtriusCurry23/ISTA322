1.  A property has both data and behavior and a field is just a variable.
1.  A method doesnt have data but properties do.
1. The ability to hide data and behavior.
1. The implication this has is it makes errors harder to find and the code harder to translate. No i dont think that naming something with a lower case makes it harder to distungish them.
1. If someone has a SSN number they might want to view it but they cant change it. If you have an internal count inside of your buisness and you dont want the general public to view it you just set it.
1. A reason would be to not allow users to view or change anything in the class. An getters and setters should never be private.
1.  A property can contain at most one get accessor and one set accessor. A property cannot contain other methods, fields, or properties.
1. Code that calls the default constructor and the syntax looks like : public int NumSides { get; set; }
